### The Data

The dataset consists of 46000 sparsely annotated images containing 4200 bounding boxes. Each image has dimensions of (1000,1000,3), corresponding to a 0.25 sq km patch of ground with a pixel pitch of 0.5m. Instructions for accessing and using the data can be found on [Github](https://github.com/michaelthoreau/satellite-imagery-search-and-rescue).

### The Story

<br />


Jame's 'Kiwi' Johnson, a New Zealand born paragliding pilot was flying with two fellow pilots over the mountains of Nevada. His goal for the day was to use the natural potential of thermal updrafts to cover more than 200km, something that would make our jobs difficult over the coming weeks. He was to follow the thermals and surf between mountain ranges, gaining altitude above peaks and gliding across valleys. The three pilots had planned to rendezvous in a town close to the utah border at the completion of the flight. Hours later Kiwi hadn't made an appearance, something not atypical for those in the freeflight community trying to cover large distances with some uncertainty in the availibility of lift. It is not uncommon for a pilot to have to land and hike out with their gear before hitchhiking in to town.
