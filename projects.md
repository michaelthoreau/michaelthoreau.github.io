          <strong>Bruxism Monitoring - More Data means More Solutions?</strong><br />
          Surely the reason medical monitoring equipment is so expensive is the high sensor costs? This is almost certtainly not the case, medical devices are expensive, likely due to high both R&D costs and certification requirements.

          Lightweight and low power sensors however, can lead to unobtrusive monitoring devices capable of long-term data recording. The motivation for this project was to study whether it is possible to use ML on an embedded device to capture <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruxism">bruxism</a> events while a patient sleeps. Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography">EMG</a> as a ground truth, it may be possible to learn a classifier that works on accelerometer data only. Pictured below is a device I designed as a research platform. It has sufficient onboard flash memory to capture Accelerometer and EMG data for several nights, to be transferred over USB upon the return of the device from the patient.

          <strong>European Student Earth Orbiter - Ground Station Antenna Control</strong><br />

          On an exchange visit to the Technical University of Munich, I had the privilege to work in the Institute for Communications and Navigation with a Masters student, Marcus Buttke. Together we designed and implemented a vertical axis control system for a 4m s-band antenna reflector. This antenna is now used for the main high speed downlink for the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Education/ESEO/ESEO_student_satellite_successfully_launched_to_space">European Student Earth Orbiter</a>. A 50kg Micro-Satellite which launched successfully in Dec 2018 aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9.

          <strong>Microphone Array Hardware for Robotics - Thesis Project and Internship</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          For my undergraduate thesis I designed a new high-performance microphone array, linked directly in to a hybrid <a href="https://www.aldec.com/en/company/blog/144--introduction-to-zynq-architecture">Xilinx Zynq FPGA</a> for real-time processing onboard a <b>robot</b>.

          <br />
          The complex interfacing between the FPGA fabric, the front-end ADC and the linux kernel taught me a huge amount about computer architecture and memory, however I would avoid this work for a research project if given a second go. <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs42401-019-00026-w.pdf">Here</a> is an example of a machine learning method for source localisation. This research has grown significantly recently, along with the rise of circular speakers with inbuilt assistants. Does the Amazon Echo Dot hardeware below look familiar?
