## Me

I am an Electrical Engineering graduate student at NYU with a past life working in robotics. After graduating with degrees in Engineering and Science from the University of Queensland I spent two years working on AI, autonomous vehicles, and aerospace projects at the Australian version of NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab - the [CSIRO Robotics and Autonomous Systems Group](https://research.csiro.au/robotics/).
