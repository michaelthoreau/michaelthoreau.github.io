## Me
I am an Electrical Engineering graduate student at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Before moving to New York City in January 2020, I worked within the [Robotics and Autonomous Systems Group](https://research.csiro.au/robotics/) at CSIRO in Australia. After graduating with degrees in Engineering and Science from the University of Queensland, I spent two years working on topics ranging from autonomous vehicle software design to 'self-supervised' machine learning research.
