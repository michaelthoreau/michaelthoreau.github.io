## Me

I am an Electrical Engineering graduate student at NYU with a past life working in robotics. After graduating with degrees in Engineering and Science from the University of Queensland I spent two years working in deep-learning and computer vision for autonomous vehicles and other projects at the Australian version of NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, the [CSIRO Robotics and Autonomous Systems Group](https://research.csiro.au/robotics/).
