## Me

I am an Electrical Engineering graduate student with two years experience in the [Robotics and Autonomous Systems Group](https://research.csiro.au/robotics/) at CSIRO, in Brisbane, Australia. My current research involves **Self-Supervised Learning** and object understanding in video. I also spend some of my time working on 3D object detection for industrial safety. Read about my other research and interest on my [projects](projects) page.

I am currently a graduate student at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. I studied for my undergraduate degree at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.
